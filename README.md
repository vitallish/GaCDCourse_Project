GaCDCourse_Project
==================

Please download and unzip the UCI HAR Dataset found at this website: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Unzip this file into the working directory. An explanation of all the data can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

You can run the run_analysis.R file once the database is unzipped. This function will combine the training and test set, label the variables and the activities with descriptive names and create a summary table saved to "summary.txt" in the working directory.
